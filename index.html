		<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8"><p><b>James Clerk Maxwell</b> <span class="initialism"> (13 June 1831 – 5 November 1879)</span> was a Scottish scientist in the field of mathematical physics. His most notable achievement was to formulate the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the first time electricity, magnetism, and light as manifestations of the same phenomenon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell's equations</a> for electromagnetism have been called the "second great unification in physics" after the first one realised by Isaac Newton.</p>
			
			<blockquote>"[Maxwell's work is the] most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton."<footer>Einstein, <i>on the centenary of Maxwell's birthday</i></footer></blockquote>			
			
<p>With the publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field"><i>A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field</i></a> in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic fields travel through space as waves moving at the speed of light. Maxwell proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena. The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to the prediction of the existence of radio waves.</p>

		Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the <strong>greatest influence</strong> on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. In the millennium poll—a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists—Maxwell was voted <strong>the third greatest physicist of all time</strong>, behind only Newton and Einstein.
